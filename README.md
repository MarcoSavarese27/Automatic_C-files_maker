# Automatic_C-files_maker
A simple shell script that makes folders and C-FIles(with makefile) for "Sistemi operativi e lab. (UNIMORE)" exercises.
The code is very shallow, because I didn't find any alternative to the "echo" command in order to do the "makefile" file, I hope someone will see this script and improve it
